Innovative Idea: 

Our idea is a website for student clubs, with categories of interest that can be easily joined. Students can petition to create new categories with enough interest, and popular categories can petition to register as RSOs. Each category will have discussion boards and areas to share related content (videos, pictures, audio). This idea relates to the existing Campus Pulse application in that we hope to improve it and make clubs more accessible to new people. 

Important Components:

Students create accounts with their Spire IDs to login. Once logged in, new users see a bunch of cards (with pictures) corresponding to clubs/interests and are prompted to select the ones that interest them. When a card is clicked, the club displays an “about us” video, and when a student is accepted, a little song plays. Users receive notifications when their club posts and for tryouts/auditions/meetings. Each club also has an “about us” section where they display important information such as schedules, meeting locations, etc.
